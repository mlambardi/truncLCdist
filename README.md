# truncLCdist
A non-uniform random number generation package in `R` for simulating extremely truncated log-concave distributions

This package implements an acceptance-rejection algorithm for sampling from a log-concave distribution and all its truncations to intervals in the form `]a,b]`.

There exists several `R` packages aimed at simulating truncated distributions, but often they are targeted at only few distributions. The package `truncLCdist` implements support for Tweedie distributions, like normal, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, exponential, gamma, inverse-Gaussian. The user can add other distributions, provided they are **log-concave**. In fact, one can simulate any such distribution via Devroye's method (1986, 1987), just by providing:

* `f(x)` probability mass/density function, with its logarithmic version `f(x, log=T)=log f(x)`
* `F(x)=P(Xâ‰¤x)` cumulative distribution function, with its logarithmic version `F(x, log.p=T)=log F(x)`
* `m=arg max f(x)` mode of the distribution

## Installation
In the `R` console, load the `devtools` library via
```
require(devtools)
```
if installed or, first, install it via
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then, you can install `truncLCdist` via
```
install_github("mlambardi/truncLCdist")
```
All the missing dependencies can be installed with `install.packages` since available in the `CRAN`.
