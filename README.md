# truncLCdist
A non-uniform random number generation package in `R` for simulating extremely truncated log-concave distributions

This package implements an acceptance-rejection algorithm for sampling from a log-concave distribution and all its truncations to intervals in the form `]a,b]`.

There exist several `R` packages aimed at simulating truncated distributions, but often they are targeted at only few distributions. The package `truncLCdist` implements support for Tweedie distributions, like normal, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, exponential, gamma, inverse-Gaussian. The user can add other distributions, provided they are **log-concave**. In fact, one can simulate any such distribution via Devroye's method (1986, 1987), just by providing:

* `f(x)` probability mass/density function (PMF/PDF), with its logarithmic version `f(x, log=T)=log f(x)`
* `F(x)=P(Xâ‰¤x)` cumulative distribution function (CDF), with its logarithmic version `F(x, log.p=T)=log F(x)`
* `d log f(x)` derivative of the logarithm of the PDF, which helps when the CDF fails
* `m=arg max f(x)` mode of the distribution

## Installation

See [the wiki](../../wiki/Installation) for installation instructions.

## Usage

Try it out with:
```
truncLCdist::rtruncLC(n, spec, ..., a=-Inf, b=+Inf)
```
It will attempt to generate `n` variates distributed as `spec`, with optional parameters `...`, but truncated to the interval `[a,b]`. Try for instance
```
truncLCdist::rtruncLC(1000, "norm", mean=3, a=20)
```

Built-in support for few distributions and parameter definitions:

* `"binom"`: binomial, indexed by `size` (1, 2, ...) and `prob` (between 0 and 1)
* `"pois"`: Poisson, indexed by `lambda` (positive)
* `"nbinom"`: negative-binomial, indexed by `size` (1, 2, ...) and `prob` (between 0 and 1)
* `"geom"`: geometric, indexed by `prob` (between 0 and 1)
* `"gamma"`: gamma, indexed by `shape` (positive) and `rate` or `scale` (both positive)
* `"norm"`: normal, indexed by `mean` (real) and `sd` (positive)
* `"invgauss"`: inverse-Gaussian, indexed by `mean` (positive) and `shape` or `dispersion` (positive)
