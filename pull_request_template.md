@mlambardi is responsible for the package and the default distributions.

We are looking forward to expand the set of default distributions, or improve the existing ones.

Please, tell us whether:
a. There are issues with existing distributions,
b. There are possibly useful distributions missing in the package.

We would be happy to include new default distributions, provided there exists an R package in the CRAN that reliably implements the density, the CDF, and so on.

Please, refer to packages in the CRAN if the distribution is --say-- mainstream. If exotic distributions are at stake, please, indicate reliable packages on GitHub implementing them.
