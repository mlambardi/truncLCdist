Description: This package implements random number generation for some famous probability distributions.
    It includes the exponential families (inverse Gaussian, Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, gamma) and other log-concave distributions, which can be sampled Ã -la Devroye.
    This package is intended as an improvement to the pre-existing package "truncdist", especially when it comes to tail distributions, wherein it seems prone to instability.
