**Which distribution should we touch**
Please tell us whether you think some distribution should be implemented better or added.

**Propose a solution**
Please help us find descriptors (density, CDF, etc) for the distribution on focus, possibly available in the CRAN and perhaps robust to errors.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
